		following are the calculation steps:

		(1) the equation of a sphere x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2
		
		(2) the equation of a ray P = O + tD 
			(O is the origin of the ray and D is the normalized vector which corresponds to the ray direction and P 
			is a point at the end of the ray based on the scaling factor t. t is in fact the parametric distance from the origin of the ray 
			to the point of interest along the ray) 
		
		(3) if x, y, and z in equation 1 are the coordinates of point P in equation 2: P^2 - R^2 = 0
			(when the sphere is not centered at the origin, equation 2 is equal to  |P - C|^2 - R^2 = 0 (equation 3) 
		
		(4) equation 3 can be rewritten as |O + tD - C|^2 - R^2 = 0 (equation 4), where C is the center of the sphere in space
		
		(5) equation 4 is a quadratic function where a = 1 (dot product of a normalized vector with itself) and 
			b = 2D(O-C) and c = |O-C|^2 - R^2.

			if delta = 0, the ray intersects the sphere in one point only (t1=t2)
			if delta < 0, the ray does not intersect with the sphere.
